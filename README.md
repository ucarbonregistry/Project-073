5.00 MW Small Scale Hydro Power project by M/S Snowdew Hydroelectric Power Projects Pvt. Ltd.
The proposed project activity with title under UCR “5.0 MW (2X 2.5 MW) Small Scale Hydro Power project by M/S Snowdew Hydroelectric Power Projects Pvt. Ltd.”, is a grid connected Hydro Electric Power project located in Chamba district in the state of Himachal Pradesh (India). The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

UCR is a simple, fast and scalable protocol to accelerate the mining of voluntary carbon & water credits from green projects. Universal Carbon Registry was established on 11 July 2021 and is the First and Largest Voluntary Carbon Credits Registry in India. UCR is also the First Registry and Standard to issue Water Offset Credits (RoUs) in the world based on actions taken for capturing/recycling/reusing unutilized sources of water that is socially and culturally equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial, achieved through site and catchment based actions independent of water quality parameters. www.ucarbonregistry.io

The project activity involves 2 numbers of Hydro Turbine Generators of Pelton Wheel Horizontal 
type (2500 kW each) with internal electrical lines connecting the project activity with local evacuation
facility. The generators generate power at 6.6 kV, which can further be stepped up to 33 kV. The
project activity can operate in the frequency of 50 Hz and the voltage of 6.6 kV

The project activity aims to harness kinetic energy of water (renewable source) to generate electricity. 
The net generated electricity from the project activity is sold to state electricity board i.e., Himachal
Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB) under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed
between the Project Proponent (PP) and the utility. In pre-project scenario the PP was importing the 
required electricity from the state utility i.e., HPSEB (is a part of regional grid, earlier known as 
NEWNE grid) to meet its captive requirement of electrical energy. Currently, NEWNE grid is 
connected to large numbers of fossil fuel-based power plants. Hence, project activity is displacing the 
gross electricity generation i.e., 42,258 MWh from the NEWNE grid, which otherwise would have 
been imported from the NEWNE grid. This project activity is also called Kiunr Hydro Electric 
project.

Country : India

State : Himachal Pradesh

District : Chamba

Village : Kiunr-Luna

The project site is located 60 km from district headquarter of Chamba district in the state of Himachal 
Pradesh. It is approximately 15 km from Luna. Metalled road from Chamba to Bharmour diverts 
towards Kiunr village from Luna approximately 45 km from Chamba. The project site is en-route on 
this road. The nearest major railway station to the project site is Pathankot Railway Station at a 
distance of about 200 kms. The geographic co-ordinate of the project locations is 32° 21' N to 32° 23' 
N and 76° 19' E to 76° 22' E.
